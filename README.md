## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository is organized into subfolders, each representing a complete and independent ML project. Projects cover various types of learning techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering.

## üîç Projects Included

This repository contains a diverse collection of machine learning projects covering a wide range of techniques, datasets, and learning paradigms. It includes:

- üîπ **Supervised Learning**: Implementation of classification and regression models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Linear Regression.
- üîπ **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering algorithms like KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering applied to real-world datasets.
- üîπ **Multiple Datasets**: Each project is built using different publicly available datasets (e.g., UCI, Kaggle) to demonstrate practical use cases.
- üîπ **Parameter Experiments**: Projects showcase performance variations with different model parameters to help understand tuning effects.
- üîπ **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, confusion matrix, silhouette score, and other metrics are used for performance analysis.
- üîπ **Modular Code Structure**: Each project has clear separation of model training, evaluation, and visualization for easy readability and reusability.

> üöÄ More projects will be added soon, including deep learning models, NLP tasks, and deployment examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

> These steps are general and can be used for any sub-project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Git (optional but recommended)
- `pip` for package installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somesh-coder-dev/ML-Projects.git
cd ML-Projects
```

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Each project folder contains a `requirements.txt` file. Navigate to the project and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üöÄ Running a Project

Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script to execute the model.

Example (inside any sub-project):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Or:

```bash
python project_script.py
```
